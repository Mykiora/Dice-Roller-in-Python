# Dice-Roller-in-Python

## Version of Python used : 3.9

## How it works

Hello, this program is my first Python Project. Basic: It Simulates random results of a dice throw based on two informations you'll need to choose :

- The number of faces 
- The number of dices

It is looped so once you've made your choices, you can run as many dices as you want with your configuration, and even modify the latter. However, everything will be reset if you close the program.

## How to run it ?

Of course, in order to run it, [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download here") has to be installed on your computer.

### Method 1
1) Open CMD (you can do this by typing cmd in the windows search bar)
2) Navigate to the directory where you put the program with the command `cd path_to_your_file`
3) Run it with the command `python dice.py`

### Method 2
Right click on the program and select "open with" then choose Python.

## End note:
I'm well aware that the program is not perfect and could have been written in a better way. As I said, this is my first project and I'm just an amateur.
